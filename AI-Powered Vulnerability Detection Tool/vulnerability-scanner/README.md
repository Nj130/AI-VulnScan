🔒 AI-Powered Vulnerability Detection Tool
An intelligent and scalable solution that leverages machine learning and static code analysis to detect potential vulnerabilities in source code. This tool aims to assist developers and security analysts in identifying security flaws early in the development lifecycle.

🚀 Features
✅ AI-based vulnerability detection using pretrained ML models

🧠 Supports static code analysis for multiple languages (Python, Java, C/C++, etc.)

📊 Interactive dashboard for reviewing and managing findings

🔁 CI/CD integration for automated security scanning

📁 Custom rules and model tuning support

🛠️ How to Use the Vulnerability Scanner

Start a New Scan:
Enter the target URL in the input field
Click "Scan for Vulnerabilities"
Wait for the scan to complete (usually 10-30 seconds)
